#### Assignment:

94-870 “Telling Stories with Data” by Christopher Goranson Final Project

#### Objective:

My final project designed to communicate to job-seeking students the historical trends of Heinz MISM students' employment records. The goal was to calm nervous students and provide helpful insights and tools for job search.
The course allowed students to choose topics of personal interest; I chose this topic because employment data is valuable and interesting to me.

#### Methodology:

- Extracted data from PDFs provided by <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/current-students/career-services/employment-information-salary-statistics" target="_blank"> Heinz Career Services</a>
- Cleaned the data and generated analytics as derivative data
- Transformed the processed data into visualisations
- Tested the idea (got user feedback from students and staff)
- Refined the message and visualisations
- Published final document

#### Tools:

- Tabula and Ilovepdf.com; data extraction from pdf
- Microsoft Excel; basic analytics
- Flourish.studio (visualisation)
- Shorthand (publishing article)
  Detailed documentation of the process is under <a href="https://michaelaffare.github.io/portfolio/tswd/" target="_blank">Project Write-ups section</a>

#### Assignment:

94-802 Geographical Information Systems (GIS) by Kristen Kurland

#### Objective:

Final Project: [Self-selected topic] To use GIS methods to establish metrics for measuring how convenient various locations/housing options are to students attending eight main universities in Pittsburgh (considering some important factors that influence convenience for a student).

#### Methodology:

- Gathered data from Census.gov, National Centre for Education Statistics, Data Axle etc.
- Cleaned the data and loaded it into ArcGIS Pro (GIS visualisation software)
- Perform three major analysis types
  [x] Buffer analysis (of number of accommodation facilities in a 1-mile radius of universities)
  [x] Network Analysis (walkability from apartments to universities)
  [x] Kernel Density Map/ heat map (by calculating the weighted impact of frequently used facilities near universities, e. g. accommodation, food, shopping, health facilities, entertainment, banking)
- Create a story map communicating the findings

#### Tools:

- ArcGIS Pro, Online (Geographical Information Systems visualisation software)
- Microsoft Excel
- SQL (within the ArcGIS Pro for basic queries)
- Storymaps (to publish the story and visualisations)

#### Other Experiences

- Teaching Assistant for 94-870 A3 “Telling Stories with Data” by Christopher Goranson for Spring 2023 (mini 3)
- Application Support Analyst, FreshTrack Systems Limited; used MS SQL, SSRS and Bold BI to generate reports and visualizations for clients within Australia's fresh foods supply chain.
