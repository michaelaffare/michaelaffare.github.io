### Introduction
This part of the project focused on how everything comes together.
- I sought inspiration from design resources and class resources
- Identified the target audience and general theme
- Created a draft storyboard (to show how the story flows and which visuals support the story)
- Did some user research (critique, interviews and opinions)
- Class review
- Modifications and improvements

### Presentation

#### Design influences/inspiration:
The resources for this week's class greatly influence my Approach to design project II.
Below are some highlighted key points from different resources provided; these lessons are reflected in the Project 2 results/draft.

> My story would follow the "Charticle" template, a narrative with charts. Sample articles that follow this style are listed below:
- <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7a2ce77c-56d1-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1" target="_blank">Donald Trumpâ€™s claims of US-Mexico border crisis, in charts</a>

- <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/520cb6f6-2958-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7" target="_blank">The Asian century is set to begin</a>

> I learnt from Nancy Duarte to:
 - Talks/Articles are more effective as stories 
 - Frequently compare "what is" with "what could be"; to rail in the audience on the vision/objective.
 - Involve the audience: create avenues for applause, laughter or marvel at some points (Be a Yoda guiding the audience in the experience)
 - Touch on topics that resonate with the audience
 - End on a high note (with a solid call to action, draw something out)
 These influenced a revision of my storyboard and story arc.

  - Relative numbers change the story (look at relative figures as well)
  - Bring the data alive
  - Visualized data can change your mindset or approach to the same information; reduces the burden of information overload.

4 . <a href="https://youtu.be/Mqrhn8khGLM" target="_blank">Explained | Racial Wealth Gap | FULL EPISODE | Netflix</a>
  - Consistent visualization/theme
  - Effective use of images and highlights 
  - Employing different types of visual elements ( sketches, cartoons, pictures and charts) to keep the audience interested and drive home the point.

#### Moodboard: To target the audience above
1. Colour scheme will follow the CMU website: Red, white and black are the dominant colours. Specific colours were found online (to create a better mental association):
  - CMU red: #c41230
  - CMU gray-black: #4d5051
2. Borrow images from the leading CMU site and the general style of the CMU website; to create a mental association and some sense of being derived from the official source.
3. Resorting to fewer words and more visuals; to engage the student audience and employer base. This will leverage the visualizations to communicate the main point.

### Storyboard: 

#### Story arc: 
> This story is "Rags to riches" themed: 
- Protagonist: A typical international CMU student, intelligent and skilled, worked hard to find a well-paying US job before graduation.
- Challenge: The hectic job search: Many career fairs, running out of time, need an offer before graduation. Added pressure causes some insecurities to surface, and the workload from school competes for attention.
- Overcome the challenge: 
Given the resources available, basic data science concepts and the learnings from "Telling stories with data", information is organized from career services resources to answer the student's questions concerning the application process and the Job market concerning the MISM program.

#### Storyboard & Wireframes:
The storyboard is previewed on Shorthand

Critical considerations in the story are from the inspirations listed above

The outline was:

1 . "The Hope of MISM" ~ CMU MISM Student
Talk about an MISM student and her prospects

2 . "The job search Hustle."
States the job search problem.
 
3 . "How jobs are found at CMU."
States how jobs are typically found in CMU (direct student search and Career services facilitated investigations)

4 . Callout statistics for Career Services reported jobs found by CMU students (within the months leading to graduation)

5 . Visualizing the statistics from Career Services to make a point of CMU MISM having value
 - Employment statistics (2015 -2022)
 - MISM job categories and their popularity
 - Companies and the job roles they have employed MISM graduates for (2015-2022)
 - Salaries reported for MISM job offers (2015 - 2022)
 - Locations that MISM job offers require graduates to work from

6 . Conclusion
 Conclude that MISM has value; based on the stories told by the data through the salaries and demand.

7 . Return on investment highlight

8 . What is Next? (Call to action)
 - MISM Student: visit career services and focus on job search
 - Employer: Contact career services to be set up in handshake for high-value talent
 - Prospective students/Public: Contact the Admissions Office

9 . Link to visit and contact Heinz College Career Services.

### User research
#### Approach to interviewee selection and Interview objective 
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Interviewee Persona</th>
    <th>Objective</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CMU MISM student</td>
    <td>Main target audience, viewpoint on the article will be critical</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CMU Alumni</td>
    <td>Might have practical questions from the real world and insights on information that might be relevant</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Career Services</td>
    <td>May have input on some key aspects that students frequently ask about or statistics to extract and display</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Admissions Office</td>
    <td>Might have an input on what to look for and how to evaluate it</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Interview script (Question and Intent)
The interviews contained seven broad questions as a template that had specific intents listed below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Intent</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How do you feel about the topic?</td>
    <td>Get the overview of the response/perception of the main audience to the topic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is the general information flow clear and smooth?</td>
    <td>Evaluate the effectiveness of the communication</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>What information surprised you (stood out most)?</td>
    <td>Identify some focus areas in the story to highlight or to check if interest is sustained or escalating long the story</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Do you have any unanswered questions after reading this (any confusion on unaddressed interests)?</td>
    <td>Discover areas of the story to build on and address interests that have not been accounted for in the story</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What do you think you can do with this information? </td>
    <td>Identify strong call to actions</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Does the colour scheme and general design work for you (tell me why)?</td>
    <td>Check if the mood board and theme is working</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What would you do differently?</td>
    <td>Get new ideas/inspiration</td>
  </tr>
</table>



#### Interview Results (Question and Intent)
It was free interaction with the interviewees, so other discussions came up using the template as a guide for the review.
The table below captures the comments, Things to Note, and things ToDo.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Alumni</th>
    <th>MISM Student</th>
    <th>General Public</th>
     <th><b>Things to Note and improve</b></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>How do you feel about the topic?</td>
    <td>It's a relevant topic; wondering if the data was available already</td>
    <td>It was interesting</td>
    <td>Well done; insightful</td>
    <td>Topic resonates with different audience</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is the general information flow clear and smooth?</td>
    <td>The general idea is clear, but it could be better articulated in a concise way</td>
    <td>Story is relatable and it captured my attention</td>
    <td>I skipped most of the text; I just spent most of the time playing with the visuals</td>
    <td>Too many words at the beginning, need to trim it. Visuals work</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>What information surprised you (stood out most)?</td>
    <td>The salaries are rising for new graduates.</td>
    <td>There are so many job roles and titles. Some top companies don't hire a lot from CMU</td>
    <td>The program gets people a good salary, and they get to work in top companies</td>
    <td>Story highlights are the salary and the job/companies visuals; improve that segment and build up to that</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Do you have any unanswered questions after reading this (any confusion on unaddressed interests)?</td>
    <td>1. Paragraphs are disjoint; was distracting </br> 2. The location background is pixelated. You could use a real map of the US </td>
    <td>Repeating job titles, these could be aggregated</td>
    <td> I Wasn't sure what MISM-BIDA and MISM-GLOBAL in the filters meant</td>
    <td>Clarify abbreviations in text or at the end of the page; a hint that there are different program tracks </br> Use ArcGIS Maps to generate a map</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What do you think you can do with this information? </td>
    <td>Inform my recruitment team to scout for CMU students. We can afford it at this mean price</td>
    <td>Ask for more money in interviews</td>
    <td>Just know; and encourage friends to do this course if they are interested in IT</td>
    <td>People have different use cases for the insights; hence slightly different call to actions</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Does the colour scheme and general design work for you (tell me why)?</td>
    <td>Good</td>
    <td>Nice, has CMU colours</td>
    <td>Ok, but it can be more professional since it is for a university</td>
    <td>Theme is good, design can be smoother</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What would you do differently?</td>
    <td>Better narrative</td>
    <td>neater graphs (less busy)</td>
    <td>More professional style</td>
    <td>Improve overall design</td>
  </tr>
</table>


#### Classroom review (Secondary Review)
After a group discussion of the topic and points
> What worked?
 - The topic is good.
 - The theme (red, black, white) suggests an association with CMU.
 - High-value visualizations

> What didn't work?
 - too many data points make charts look busy 
 It- Not intuitive that the visuals are interactive
 - Callout statistics counting too slow; try to speed it up; no one will wait

> What questions came up?
 - Why do filter if it is only about MISM; indicate that there are different tracks of MISM students

> What new inspiration arose?
 - Change one of the two similar tree maps for the jobs and companies visualization for diversity
 - convert the word cloud to an image to replace one of the scroll motion images
 - Explore more callout statistics and other visualizations except for images and charts.

#### todo list from class review
> Low effort with high value
- [X] Switch chart type (for diversity)
- [X] Change word cloud to image 

>  High effort with high value
- [ ] Categorise data further
- [ ] Check colour options
- [ ] Improve the narrative (too hollow/placeholder)

### Shorthand (AFTER user review/critique)

<a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/43RPijMCwDAk7dS2" target="_blank">After user review/research/critique</a> 

Some changes were successfully made to the initial design
> Low effort with high value
- [X] Checked for typos
- [X] Added footnotes to charts that are interactive (so users will know to interact with them)
- [X] Varied some visualizations that looked too similar
- [X] Added a closing page that had a link (indirectly making a call to action)

>  High effort with high value
- [X] Further categorizing the data
- [ ] Improve the narrative (too hollow/placeholder); shorting the first few pages of text (be more engaging)

### Conclusion
Developing the idea beyond data extraction has matured over the past week.
Progress looks very different from how I envisioned it during part 1, primarily due to the inspiration from the many resources provided to guide students on storytelling with data.
Although not everything can be incorporated, and this project is "baby steps", I can see the value of thinking about data and storytelling as a craft that can be honed.
The principles and iterations from mood boards to sketches and the incorporation of principles that influenced theme development made me appreciate the many background decisions needed to communicate a story through data.
I love this experience.
