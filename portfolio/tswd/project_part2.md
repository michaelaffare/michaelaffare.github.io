### Storyboard
#### Design influences/inspiration:
The resources for this week's class greatly influence my approach to designing project II.
Below are some highlight keypoints picked from different resources provided; these lessons reflect in the Project 2 results/draft.

2 . <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/story-templates-financial-times-reusable/" target="_blank"> Financial times: Story Templates:</a> 

> My story would follow the "Charticle" template; a narrative with charts. Sample articles that follow this style are listed below:
- <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7a2ce77c-56d1-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1" target="_blank">Donald Trumpâ€™s claims of US-Mexico border crisis, in charts</a> 
- <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80a76f38-e3be-11e6-8405-9e5580d6e5fb" target="_blank">The huge disparities in US life expectancy in five charts</a> 
- <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/520cb6f6-2958-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7" target="_blank">The Asian century is set to begin</a> 

 

3 . <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nancy_duarte_the_secret_structure_of_great_talks?referrer=playlist-how_to_make_a_great_presentation" target="_blank">Tedtalk: Secret structure of a great talk</a>

> I learnt from Nancy Duarte to:
 - Talks/Articles are more effective as stories 
 - Frequently compare what is with what could be; to rail in the audience on the vision/objective.
 - Involve the audience: create avenues for applause, laughter or marvel at some points (Be a Yoda guiding the audience in the experience)
 - Touch on topics that resonate with the audience
 - End on a high note (with a strong call to action, draw something out)
 These influenced a revision of my storyboard and story arc.

> <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization?referrer=playlist-how_to_make_a_great_presentation" target="_blank">David McCandless</a>
  - Relative numbers chang the story (look at relative figures as well)
  - Bring the data alive
  - Visualised data can change your mindset or approach to the same information; reduces the burden of information overload.

4 . <a href="https://youtu.be/Mqrhn8khGLM" target="_blank">Explained | Racial Wealth Gap | FULL EPISODE | Netflix</a>
  - Consistent visualization/theme
  - Effective use of images and highlights 
  - Employing different types of visuals elements ( sketches, cartoons, pictures and charts) to keep the audience interest and drive home the point.

#### Moodboard:
1. Colour scheme will follow CMU website: Red, white and black dominant colours
2. Borrow images from the main CMU site and general style of the CMU website; to create a mental association and some sense of being derived from the official source.
3. Resorting to fewer words and more visuals; to engage the student audience and employer base. Leveraging the visualistions to communicate the main point.


#### Story arc: 
> This story is "A rags to riches" themed: 
- Protagonist: A typical international CMU student, smart and skilled, worked hard to find a good paying US job before graduation.
- Challenge: The hectic job search: Many career fairs, running out of time, need an offer before graduation. Added pressure causes some insecurities to surface and workload from school competes for attention.
- Overcome the challenge: 
Given the resources available, basic data science concepts and the learnings from "Telling stories with data", information is organized from career services resources to answer the questions that the student has concerning the application process and Job market with respect to MISM program.


#### Storyboard overview 

##### 1: MISM & The MISM student 
 Every year, there are hundreds of brilliant MISM student like Eva, who have travelled from halfway across the world to study at CMU. 
 Her hope, and that of her family paying over $80,000, is that she will hone her skills and become one of the leading talents in the technology and Information Systems industry in the United States. 
 Her grades, talents and previous experiences all point to the fact that this is possible.
 Her CMU studies have progressed steadily and she is now a semester or two away from graduating.

#### 2: The job search hustle
The search for jobs often is intense.
There are several emails, job postings to browse, career fairs, and interviews.
The resume reviews, cover letters, and alumni events to attend are also many.
All this alongside the CMU course workload.

When after a month or two there has not be any major job offers or leads, students begin to panic.
Sometimes even doubting their abilities or limitations.

### 3: The resources and support CMU career services provides
Thankfully CMU provides helpful resources to guide students through the job appliction process.
An application called "Handshake" has helpful training and interview prep resources and is the hub for companies seeking out CMU students to employ.
The Heinz website also has helpful information on previous salaries and employment statistics that students can reference as a guide.
Thankfully all this information was publicly available on the Heinz Website:  <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/current-students/career-services/employment-information-salary-statistics" target="_blank">heinz.cmu.edu Employment Information Salary Statistics</a> as PDFs organized by program.

1. How many students apply for MSISM and complete the program?

2. What has been the employment rate of students who graduate from the MISM program?

7. Conclusion 1: Summary; the value of a CMU MISM degree
8. Conclusion 2: Call to action: See career services, identify your skills and matching roles, and target the companies listed that offer those roles.


#### 5: Call to action
The call to action would be for MISM students
1. To be aware and have the mental picture discussed in mind during the job search
2. Price appropriately looking at trends and averages
3. Check other job roles within the category of roles and search for those jobs during the job search
4. Sign-up for career fairs for companies that frequently offer roles of interest.

To Employers:
1. Contact career services to find top talent to be able to compete with the top companies 

To career services / Admissions
1. share with students and public who might benefit from knowing the value of a CMU degree over the years.

### Classroom review
After a group discussion of the topic and points
> What worked?

> What didn't work?

> What questions came up?

> What new inspiration arose?

#### todo list from class review
