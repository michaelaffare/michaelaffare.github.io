## Standard (guided) Visualization of government data (from Flourish)
This visualization below copmares the debt to GDP ratio of the various companies using the same data set from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

This data generally suggests a rise in the Debt-to-GDP for most countries represented for the year of 2021.

## The Government Debt of G7 Countries 1995-2020: 
### The rise of Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio versus Canada's impressive management of government debt
#### By Michael Affare
This Line Chart race visualization uses data from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to view the Government debt of the G7 [(Group of Seven)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7) nations from 1995 to 2020.
It focuses on the sharp rise of the government debt of Japan and the gradual drop of the debt-to-GDP ratio of Canada.
It also Ranks the G7 nations over time according to the rate of rise in their government debts.

It is interesting the spotlight this shines of Japan and suggests that perhaps there is something that Canada is doing right that other G7 nations can learn from.

The sharp curve from 2019 to 2020 is likely correlated to Covid 19 however since it is almost uniformly observed across all the G7 countries it may be inferred that Covid-19 had an observable impact on all the major economics. What is next is to observe how these countries perform in the coming years post pandemic.

Note: 
UK data was not present so Great Britain data was used as a representative of the whole of UK  (Brexit was not factored into this assumption)

#### Design choises
- This original dataset was filtered for the G7 data and transposed to fit the Flourish platform table structure required for the Line Chart race.
- This visualization was choisen because it factors in interactive design principles; the race from 1995 shows the gradual change both in rank and cost of the various G7 nations.
- The use of grey to blur into the background the other 5 countries allows the viewer to focus on the two main focus countries (Japan and Canada).
- Red was chosen for Japan to symbolize the alert (alarming nature) of it's rise in government debt, whiles cool blue was chosen to depict positivity in the drop of the debt-to-GDP ratio of Canada.
> For simplicity:
- The country abbreviations were maintained (i.e. JPN, ITA, USA, GBR, FRA, CAN and DEU) since given the context of G7 nations, those abbreviations can intuitively be recognised by the reader without the clutter of spelling them in full.
- Also the axis are purposely not labeled as the y-axis can intutively be recognized as the debt-to-GDP ration and the x-axis as the years from 1995 to 2020 (the interactive race gives a hint)
