## Step 2 - Critique the solution 
Summary:
These 5 CNBC visualizations on the topic “Marvel heroes propelled Disney to the top of the 2021 domestic box office” adopted 5 simple and intuitive “segmented bar graph”, “bar graphs” and a “3-column table” (with a small bar graph visualization in the 3rd column) to communicate information that could support the case. Although these 5 visualizations are individually clear and true facts, they do not effectively provide a consolidated visual that highlights the main point of Disney doing better because of Marvel movies as compared to other distributors/studios. The viewer will need to give it some extra though or come up with a small mental sketch to derive the conclusion being made by the 5 visuals. The entertainment segment reader of CNBC articles may want a simple visual that already provides direct visual comparisons (not just for individual movies) but of the studios; The author also assumed the reader can identify which movie is a Marvel movie and which one is not (as there were no highlights in any of the graphs to display the distinction between Marvel movies and other movies). 3 out of 5 of the visualizations also did not clarify that the gross amounts mentioned were considering only North America, which is an important clarification for viewers and data credibility standpoint (to avoid viewers questioning some of the numbers or underestimate the total earning). Generally, the 5 graphs are aesthetically simple and clean but not very engaging. They are useful, true, and intuitive but may need some improvement to make them collectively useful to the reader and perceptible (convey the point of the article more directly).
