### Introduction

Part III captures how everthing comes together for the final product:

- Final audience review
- Supplementary data sources
- Final finishing touches
- Real audience feedback
- Final Presentation and final critique
- Final publication
- Retrospection
- Conclusion

### Final audience review

At the start of Part III I had identified 3 main audience groups, The students, Potential employeers and the general public. The part II draft tried to address the needs of all these audiences and it resulted in a less focused (flat toned) message. The call to action also felt all over the place.

As part of the Part II grading feedback Professor and the TA made two main suggestions

[ ] Decide on a specific target audience so the message can be more effective.
[ ] Call to action must be more relevant and clear.
[ ] What unique value (aside presenting the data on CMU website) is the audience expected to get from this.

Thinking through this grading feedback I discovered that:

- Because I tried too hard to address every audience group the message lost it's impact
- Choosing a single main audience could inform a more impactful call to action and messaging of the article.

Eventually I decided to address the "MISM student seeking a job" as my main audience group.
Once I did that the call to action became much clearer and the core message of the entire article changed to focus on the main concern of the student; anxiety as graduation draws nearer and the job search season closes.

Because I am a student in a similar situation, I could relate more with the audience and personalise the story to make it more relatable. The subtitle for the article changed from an in-personal subtitle

> "Visualizing the Master of Information Systems Management program's value and demand."

to

> "Painting a calming picture for the job-seeking Master of Information Systems Management student.""

These may seem like minor changes, but it really gave a face-lift to the entire message and made it more engaging.

#### Supplementary data sources:

Although the main data source from Heinz College website was rich and volumnous, the initial draft seemed like simply a subset or summary of the Heinz website content.
The main value of the article was identified as visualizing the 32 PDF documents to be able to tell a story, but this silo information could benefit from some additional data that would provide context in the US job market.
This was a feedback received after the classroom presentation and was also captured in Part II grading.
And it made perfect sense as the topic of the article was ". . . IN THE US JOB MARKET" I needed to set the stage.

So I worked on a few elements that provided more context on the US job market and augmented the core dataset. Some are listed below:

> Bureau of Labour Statistics, Sept 2022:
> This report captured an important statistic that unemployment rates had declined to a 3.8% as at September 2022.
> This was an additional callout statistic that would be calming for a job seeking MISM student to hear.

> US Census Bureau: Income and poverty in the United States:
> This dataset provided 3 years of data on the average salary of "degree holder and higher" salaries which was estimated to be $49,000.
> This information was also effectively integrated into the Salary graphs to help provide context that the worst case salary reported for MISM student was often higher than the average salaries of degree holders (and people with higher qualifications).
> This additional line introduced an important comparison that puts the MISM degree in perspective (within the US job market).

It was interesting how Focusing on an audience let to identifying the exact focus and motive of the article. This also informed the additional information that will be required to drive home the specific points made.

#### Final finishing touches

The story was editted, from a third person narrative to a first person narrative (since I identify with the audience).
Also some statements for changed to be made more inclusive and direct because the audience was one group and now allowed for such direct callouts.
Notwithstanding, that other audience groups could still find what they need from the article eventhough it was a more indirect approach and I find that not much was compromised or lost by focusing on the main audience.

- Colours were double checked,
- typos were corrected (text was run through grammarly for more concise wording and a double-check on the spelling).
- Labels on the Salary graph were changed from a decimal timeline (which was awkward) to a date timeline which more readers will be familiar with.

1. <b>Copyright checks</b>
   One crucial aspect of publishing content publicly is that the need to ensure that all content that are not original are properly sited and that there is permission to use the content.

   My article used many images from unsplash that are all opensource and without a need to copyright.

2. <b>Citations:</b>
   I included citations for all data sources to the bottom of the article.
   This can be helpful for people who want to verify some data sources or follow-up with further reading.

Although some of these extra steps may seem cumbersome, they really go a long way to protect the author, increase credibility and generally give the write-up a professional look and feel.
At the end of this it looked and felt more like a professional job.

#### Real audience feedback

The final output was shared with a few people to get feedback.
The responses were really good and most people felt it was ready to be submitted.

There was one technical correction on the use of the phrase "Return on Investment"; it was updated to "breakeven time".

The need for fewer changes and the feedback that the work was ready to submit was satisfying; seemed like the many iterations was paying off.

#### Final Presentation and final critique

There was a 1 minute final presentation (elevator pitch) for the topic in class.
This was an interesting excercise as it allowed students to capture the key points of their presentation within a minute.
The experience of keeping the presentation concise and on topic was good training.
Hearing from other students presenting on different topics was also interesting.

My presentation attempted to engage the audience by making it interactive (with questions), personalizing the story and being relateable (as learnt in part II resources).

A feedback from the class presentation (including other resources that capture context for the ". . . US job market").

##### Final publication

The text for the publication will be run through turnItIn to identify any concerns for uncited quotations or similarities to other work; this is to avoid any complications with copyright and plagiarism. As all of the content were originally created (except the cited unsplash images) I do not anticipate any challenges with TurnItIn.

Shorthand also has a feature to publish the draft. This provides a final publicly accessible URL that is under the Carnegie Mellon account.

This final link was tested by a few friends to ensure it returned the expected results.
It was also viewed from different browsers and a mobile device to be aware of how the page renders from different accounts.

##### Retrospection

Looking back on the journey from idea formulation, data collection, storymap and mood boards, to draft arcticles
I realised that my initial thoughts of how this article would play out is miles apart from the result of the iterative process (in a good way).
Many major and minor considerations influenced the approach and design of the final product.

Looking back, I would have done 3 things differently

- Focus on one main audience group earlier; as things became much clearer after choosing the MISM job-seeking student as the primary audience
- Identify the main call to action much earlier for the single target audience; ideas begun to flow easily when the motivation for the write-up became clearer.
- Start from the motive, and get the data that supports it from many credible sources (not get the data and build the audience and motivation afterward). It pays to have a clear objective right from the beginning.

### Conclusion

In all, I have enjoyed learning this process of Telling Stories with Data.
It has been an engaging, rewarding process.
I can clearly see many professional opportunities open up to me after refining this skill.
I recognise that it is a continuous learning process but I believe with practise practise and more practise this skillset will grow into a significant professional proficiency that my teams and projects will benefit from.
I look forward to telling more stories with data.

> I would like to say a special thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisgoranson/" target="_blank">Professor Christopher Goranson</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/delaney-sears/" target="_blank">Delaney Sears (TA)</a> for putting together this very practical learning experience for us students. We appreciate the effort that went into putting together the resources and incoperating our feedback into the course delivery.

Thank you for going on this journey with me.
Hopefully I told a good story with this data.
