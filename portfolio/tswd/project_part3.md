### Introduction

Part III captures how everthing comes together for the final product:

- Final audience review
- Supplementary data sources
- Final finishing touches
- Real audience feedback
- Presentation and final critique
- Final publication
- Retrospection
- Conclusion

### Final audience review

At the start of Part III I had identified 3 main audience groups, The students, Potential employeers and the general public. The part II draft tried to address the needs of all these audiences and it resulted in a less focused (flat toned) message. The call to action also felt all over the place.

As part of the Part II grading feedback Professor and the TA made two main suggestions

- [ ] Decide on a specific target audience so the message can be more effective.
- [ ] Call to action must be more relevant and clear.
- [ ] What unique value (aside presenting the data on CMU website) is the audience expected to get from this.

Thinking through this grading feedback I discovered that:

- Because I tried too hard to address every audience group the message lost it's impact
- Choosing a single main audience could inform a more impactful call to action and messaging of the article.

Eventually I decided to address the "MISM student seeking a job" as my main audience group.
Once I did that the call to action became much clearer and the core message of the entire article changed to focus on the main concern of the student; anxiety as graduation draws nearer and the job search season closes.

Because I am a student in a similar situation, I could relate more with the audience and personalise the story to make it more relatable. The subtitle for the article changed from an in-personal subtitle

> Visualizing the Master of Information Systems Management program's value and demand

to

> Painting a calming picture for the job-seeking Master of Information Systems Management student.

These may seem like minor changes, but it really gave a face-lift to the entire message and made it more engaging.

#### Supplementary data sources:

Although the main data source from Heinz College website was rich and volumnous, the initial draft seemed like simply a subset or summary of the Heinz website content.
The main value of the article was identified as visualizing the 32 PDF documents to be able to tell a story, but this silo information could benefit from some additional data that would provide context in the US job market.
This was a feedback received after the classroom presentation and was also captured in Part II grading.
And it made perfect sense as the topic of the article was ". . . IN THE US JOB MARKET" I needed to set the stage.

So I worked on a few elements that provided more context on the US job market and augmented the core dataset. Some are listed below:

> Bureau of Labour Statistics, Sept 2022:
> This report captured an important statistic that unemployment rates had declined to a 3.8% as at September 2022.
> This was an additional callout statistic that would be calming for a job seeking MISM student to hear.

> US Census Bureau: Income and poverty in the United States:
> This dataset provided 3 years of data on the average salary of "degree holder and higher" salaries which was estimated to be $49,000.
> This information was also effectively integrated into the Salary graphs to help provide context that the worst case salary reported for MISM student was often higher than the average salaries of degree holders (and people with higher qualifications).
> This additional line introduced an important comparison that puts the MISM degree in perspective (within the US job market).

It was interesting how Focusing on an audience let to identifying the exact focus and motive of the article. This also informed the additional information that will be required to drive home the specific points made.

#### Final finishing touches

The story was editted, from a third person narrative to a first person narrative (since I identify with the audience).
Also some statements for changed to be made more inclusive and direct because the audience was one group and now allowed for such direct callouts.
Notwithstanding, that other audience groups could still find what they need from the article eventhough it was a more indirect approach and I find that not much was compromised or lost by focusing on the main audience.

Colours were double checked, typos were corrected (text was run through grammarly for more concise wording and a double-check on the spelling).

#### Moodboard: To target the audience above

1. Colour scheme will follow the CMU website: Red, white and black are the dominant colours. Specific colours were found online (to create a better mental association):

- CMU red: #c41230
- CMU gray-black: #4d5051

2. Borrow images from the leading CMU site and the general style of the CMU website; to create a mental association and some sense of being derived from the official source.
3. Resorting to fewer words and more visuals; to engage the student audience and employer base. This will leverage the visualizations to communicate the main point.

### Storyboard:

#### Story arc:

> This story is "Rags to riches" themed:

- Protagonist: A typical international CMU student, intelligent and skilled, worked hard to find a well-paying US job before graduation.
- Challenge: The hectic job search: Many career fairs, running out of time, need an offer before graduation. Added pressure causes some insecurities to surface, and the workload from school competes for attention.
- Overcome the challenge:
  Given the resources available, basic data science concepts and the learnings from "Telling stories with data", information is organized from career services resources to answer the student's questions concerning the application process and the Job market concerning the MISM program.

#### Storyboard & Wireframes:

The storyboard is previewed on Shorthand

Critical considerations in the story are from the inspirations listed above

The outline was:

1 . "The Hope of MISM" ~ CMU MISM Student
Talk about an MISM student and her prospects

2 . "The job search Hustle."
States the job search problem.

3 . "How jobs are found at CMU."
States how jobs are typically found in CMU (direct student search and Career services facilitated investigations)

4 . Callout statistics for Career Services reported jobs found by CMU students (within the months leading to graduation)

5 . Visualizing the statistics from Career Services to make a point of CMU MISM having value

- Employment statistics (2015 -2022)
- MISM job categories and their popularity
- Companies and the job roles they have employed MISM graduates for (2015-2022)
- Salaries reported for MISM job offers (2015 - 2022)
- Locations that MISM job offers require graduates to work from

6 . Conclusion
Conclude that MISM has value; based on the stories told by the data through the salaries and demand.

7 . Return on investment highlight

8 . What is Next? (Call to action)

- MISM Student: visit career services and focus on job search
- Employer: Contact career services to be set up in handshake for high-value talent
- Prospective students/Public: Contact the Admissions Office

9 . Link to visit and contact Heinz College Career Services.

The table below captures the comments, Things to Note, and things ToDo.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Question</th>
    <th>Alumni</th>
    <th>MISM Student</th>

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>What information surprised you (stood out most)?</td>
    <td>The salaries are rising for new graduates.</td>
    <td>There are so many job roles and titles. Some top companies don't hire a lot from CMU</td>

    <td>Story highlights are the salary and the job/companies visuals; improve that segment and build up to that</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Do you have any unanswered questions after reading this (any confusion on unaddressed interests)?</td>
    <td>1. Paragraphs are disjoint; was distracting </br> 2. The location background is pixelated. You could use a real map of the US </td>
    <td>Repeating job titles, these could be aggregated</td>
    <td> I Wasn't sure what MISM-BIDA and MISM-GLOBAL in the filters meant</td>
    <td>Clarify abbreviations in text or at the end of the page; a hint that there are different program tracks </br> Use ArcGIS Maps to generate a map</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What do you think you can do with this information? </td>
    <td>Inform my recruitment team to scout for CMU students. We can afford it at this mean price</td>
    <td>Ask for more money in interviews</td>

#### Classroom review (Secondary Review)

After a group discussion of the topic and points

> What worked?

- The topic is good.
- The theme (red, black, white) suggests an association with CMU.
- High-value visualizations

> What didn't work?

- too many data points make charts look busy
  It- Not intuitive that the visuals are interactive
- Callout statistics counting too slow; try to speed it up; no one will wait

> What questions came up?

- Why do filter if it is only about MISM; indicate that there are different tracks of MISM students

> What new inspiration arose?

- Change one of the two similar tree maps for the jobs and companies visualization for diversity
- convert the word cloud to an image to replace one of the scroll motion images
- Explore more callout statistics and other visualizations except for images and charts.

#### todo list from class review

> Low effort with high value

- [x] Switch chart type (for diversity)
- [x] Change word cloud to image

> High effort with high value

- [ ] Categorise data further
- [ ] Check colour options
- [ ] Improve the narrative (too hollow/placeholder)

### Shorthand (AFTER user review/critique)

<a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/43RPijMCwDAk7dS2" target="_blank">After user review/research/critique</a>

Some changes were successfully made to the initial design

> Low effort with high value

- [x] Checked for typos
- [x] Added footnotes to charts that are interactive (so users will know to interact with them)
- [x] Varied some visualizations that looked too similar
- [x] Added a closing page that had a link (indirectly making a call to action)

> High effort with high value

- [x] Further categorizing the data
- [ ] Improve the narrative (too hollow/placeholder); shorting the first few pages of text (be more engaging)

### Conclusion

Developing the idea beyond data extraction has matured over the past week.
Progress looks very different from how I envisioned it during part 1, primarily due to the inspiration from the many resources provided to guide students on storytelling with data.
Although not everything can be incorporated, and this project is "baby steps", I can see the value of thinking about data and storytelling as a craft that can be honed.
The principles and iterations from mood boards to sketches and the incorporation of principles that influenced theme development made me appreciate the many background decisions needed to communicate a story through data.
I love this experience.
