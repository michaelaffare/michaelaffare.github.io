### Introduction

Part III captures how everything comes together for the final product:

- Final audience review
- Supplementary data sources
- Final finishing touches
- Real audience feedback
- Final Presentation and final critique
- Final publication
- Retrospection
- Conclusion

### Final audience review

At the start of Part III, I had identified three primary audience groups, The students, Potential employers and the general public. The part II draft tried to address the needs of all these audiences, resulting in a less focused (flat-toned) message. However, the call to action also felt all over the place.

As part of Part II, grading feedback Professor and the TA made two leading suggestions

[X] Decide on a specific target audience so the message can be more effective.
[X] Call to action must be more relevant and precise.
[X] What unique value (aside from presenting the data on the CMU website) is the audience expected to get from this?

Thinking through this grading feedback, I discovered that:

- Because I tried too hard to address every audience group, the message lost its impact
- Choosing a single primary audience could inform the article's more impactful call to action and messaging.

Eventually, I addressed the "MISM student seeking a job" as my primary audience group.
Once I did that, the call to action became much clearer, and the core message of the entire article changed to focus on the primary concern of the student; anxiety as graduation draws nearer and the job search season closes.

Because I am a student in a similar situation, I could relate more with the audience and personalize the story to make it more relatable. The subtitle for the article changed from an in-personal subtitle

> "Visualizing the Master of Information Systems Management program's value and demand."

to

> "Painting a calming picture for the job-seeking Master of Information Systems Management student."

These may seem like minor changes, but they gave a face-lift to the entire message and made it more engaging.

#### Supplementary data sources:

Although the primary data source from the Heinz College website was rich and voluminous, the initial draft seemed like simply a subset or summary of the Heinz website content.
I identified the principal value of the article as visualizing the 32 PDF documents to be able to tell a story. In addition, the visualizations served as tools that the student could use to improve and focus their job search. Still, this silo information could benefit from additional data that would provide the context in the US job market.
This feedback was received after the classroom presentation and captured in Part II grading.
And it made perfect sense as the topic of the article was ". . . IN THE US JOB MARKET" I needed to set the stage.

So I worked on a few elements that provided more context on the US job market and augmented the core dataset. Some are listed below:

> Bureau of Labour Statistics, Sept 2022:
> This report captured an essential statistic that unemployment rates had declined to a 3.8% as of September 2022.
> This was an additional callout statistic that would be calming for a job-seeking MISM student to hear.

> US Census Bureau: Income and poverty in the United States:
> This dataset provided three years of data on the average salary of "degree holders and higher" salaries which were estimated to be $49,000.
> This information was also effectively integrated into the Salary graphs to help provide context that the worst-case salary reported for MISM students was often higher than the average salaries of degree holders (and people with higher qualifications).
> This additional line introduced a critical comparison that puts the MISM degree in perspective (within the US job market).

It was interesting how Focusing on an audience led to identifying the exact focus and motive of the article: This also informed the additional information required to drive home the specific points made.

#### Final finishing touches

I changed the voice of the story from a third person to a first-person narrative (since I identify with the audience group): This was a more practical choice.
Also, some statements changed to be more inclusive and direct because the audience was one group and now allowed for such direct callouts.
Notwithstanding, that other audience groups could still find what they needed from the article even though it was a more indirect approach, and I find that not much was compromised or lost by focusing on the primary audience.

- I double-checked my use of colours.
- I corrected as many typos as possible (I ran the text through Grammarly for more concise wording and spell-checking).
- I changed the labels on the x-axis of the salary chart; I changed it from a decimal timeline (which was awkward) to a date timeline with which more readers will be familiar.

1. <b>Copyright checks</b>
   One crucial aspect of publicly publishing content is ensuring that all content that is not original is appropriately cited and that there is permission to use the content.

   My article used many images from Unsplash that are all open source and without a need for copyright.

2. <b>Citations:</b>
   I included citations for all data sources at the bottom of the article:
   This can be helpful for people who want to verify some data sources or follow up with further reading.

Although some of these extra steps may seem cumbersome, they go a long way to protect the author, increase credibility and generally give the write-up a professional look and feel.
At this end, it looked and felt more like a professional job.

#### Real audience feedback

I shared the final output with a few people to get feedback.
The responses were excellent, and most people felt it was ready to be submitted.

There was one technical correction on the phrase "Return on Investment"; I updated this to "breakeven time". Unfortunately, this oversight would have confused people with a strong accounting/finance background who generally do not look good regarding credibility or topic expertise.

The need for fewer changes and the feedback that the work was ready to submit was satisfying; it seemed like the many iterations were paying off.

#### Final Presentation and final critique

There was a 1-minute final presentation (elevator pitch) for the topic in class:
This presentation was an exciting exercise as it allowed students to capture the critical points of their presence within a minute.
The experience of keeping the presentation concise and on the topic was good training.
Hearing from other students presenting on different topics was also interesting.

My presentation attempted to engage the audience by making it interactive (with questions), personalizing the story and being relateable (as learnt in part II resources).

Feedback from the class presentation (including other resources that capture context for the ". . . US job market").

##### Final publication

I will run the text for the publication through Turnitin to identify any concerns for uncited quotations or similarities to other works to avoid any complications with copyright and plagiarism. However, as all the content was initially created (except the cited Unsplash images), I do not anticipate any challenges with TurnItIn.

Shorthand also has a feature to publish the draft, giving a final publicly accessible URL under the Carnegie Mellon account.

I tested the final link with a few friends to ensure it returned the expected results.
It was also viewed from different browsers and mobile devices to know how the page renders from other accounts.

##### Retrospection

Looking back on the journey from idea formulation, data collection, story map and mood boards to draft articles
I realized that my initial thoughts of how this article would play out are miles apart from the result of the iterative process (in a good way).
Many major and minor considerations influenced the approach and design of the final product.

Also, FEEDBACK became one of the most effective design tools. I improved on soliciting feedback from relevant stakeholders, focusing on what will add value to the presentation and picking up on subtle comments that can lead to important insights into how another person sees my work. Generally, I have improved with not getting salty or too defensive when people don't particularly like something about my work. I found that feedback always took me one step closer to a more refined work, and most of the time, these are things I would have missed on my own.

Looking back, I would have done three things differently

- Focus on one leading audience group earlier; as things became much clearer after choosing the MISM job-seeking student as the primary audience
- Identify the main call to action much earlier for the single target audience; ideas began to flow easily when the motivation for the write-up became clearer.
- Start from the motive, and get the data that supports it from many credible sources (not get the data and build the audience and motivation afterwards). It pays to have a clear objective right from the beginning.

### Conclusion

In all, I have enjoyed learning this process of Telling Stories with Data.
It has been an engaging, rewarding process.
After refining this skill, I can see many professional opportunities open up.
I recognize that it is a continuous learning process. Still, I believe with practice practise and more technique, this skill set will grow into a significant professional proficiency from which my future teams and projects will benefit. I look forward to telling more stories with data.

> I would like to say a special thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisgoranson/" target="_blank">Professor Christopher Goranson</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/delaney-sears/" target="_blank">Delaney Sears (TA)</a> for putting together this very practical learning experience for us students. We appreciate the effort to put together the resources and incoperating our feedback into the course delivery.

Thank you for going on this journey with me.
Hopefully, I will tell a good story with this data.
