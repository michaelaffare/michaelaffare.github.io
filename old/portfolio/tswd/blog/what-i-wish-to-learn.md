## I wish to learn. . .

### Use of colour

The use of colour can be the difference between a good design and an uncomfortable design.

### Interactive Design

The Interactive design endulges its reader and allows the reader to feel more invested in the visualization or graphic.
The way a user interacts with a design can make or break the communication's effectiveness.

### Choosing the right visualization for a given data

Sometimes the hardest thing is to find the right way to visualize data.
The same data can be presented with different graph or visualization types and it will convey a very different message.
Along this course I wish to because more adept at finding the right visualization for the right data and audience.

### Simplification of visualizations

Sometimes keeping things simple can be very hard, especially when you wish to convey a lot in one visualization.
This course will make me better at desing choices that will help me remove noise from my communication and do a better job with visualisation.

### Retrospective

After 6 weeks I have learnt more about telling stories with data that I imagined I would. the resources were rich and the practical experience was amazing.
I have truly enjoyed this course.
